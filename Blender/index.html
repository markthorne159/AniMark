<h2>Getting started with Blender<h2>

<div>

<p id = "Intro">The first time you open up Blender can be daunting.
What are all these icons and buttons for?<br> What do they do? and most importantly, how do I start creating things in 3d?!<br><br> 

Click on any of the links below to automatically jump to any section.<br><br>

<p id = "Intro">
This article intends to break down Blenders user interface into separate sections<br>
and make it easier for you to get started with using the program. The user interface features 4-5 main areas <br> most of which include features and options that are used frequently.
</p>

<ul>
<li id = "ListEntry">Main Viewport</li>


</ul>
</div>

<div>
<h3 id = "STitle">The Main Viewport </h3>
<img id = "Main" src = "Images/BlenderC.png" width = "600" height = "400">

<p id = "Intro">
The first section is also the one you'll likely use the most in Blender when you're starting out.<br>
The main viewport is used to manipulate your 3d objects and other parts of your scene as such as cameras and lights. <br>
Whenever you're editing or moving objects around in the scene it's key to make sure your cursor is inside of the viewport.<br>
If you leave the cursor outside of the viewport it's likely that Blender will not recognize the command. <br>
Using the 3d viewport enables you to perform multiple operations.<br>
