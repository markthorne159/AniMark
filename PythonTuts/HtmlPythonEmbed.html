<h1> Basics Of Python </h1>
 
<p> Compared to other programming languages Python has two main differences,<br> 
the use of the word "def" instead of "function" and indentation. <br> 
Of the two things mentioned here using def over function is the easiest to get used to,<br>
all you need to do is write out the function in the exact same way as you normally would <br> 
but just replace the word "function" with "def". Python also uses a colon to start functions <br> 
as opposed to the braces or brackets that most other programming languages use.</p>

  <p>The more difficult difference to get used to is Pythons use of indents or indentation.<br>
  If you're like me and just chose to jump into Python and treat it much the same as other programming languages <br>
  you probably very quickly found that you were receiving multiple error messages saying things like "Indentation Error" <br>
  or "Python Expected an Indent". Indentation is much simpler than it sounds, whereas most programming languages allow you to <br>
  structure your code in pretty much whatever way you see fit Python requires you to start every function or statement with an indetation.<br>
  This includes if statements, while statements, for loops and any other statement you can think of. <br> 
  You may be thinking "If everything has to have an indent how do you end a statement?" Thats easy, <br> 
  all you need to do is write the next line of code at the same level of indent as the beginning of the statement. <br> 
  For example here's a simple statement: <br>
  <br>
  if(Num = 1): <br>
    print("True") <br>
  
  To exit this loop or write code that is outside of the loop you would just need to write the code as shown below.<br>
   <br>
    if(Num = 1): <br>
      print("True") <br>
    print("Done")
