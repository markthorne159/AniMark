<h1>Python: Indentation</h1>

<p id = "Content">
Python has one big difference compared to many other programming languages. <br>
Most languages let you write each line of code one after the other and use any <br>spacing or patterns you want to depending on how you like to write code. <br>
<br>
Python however follows a format which requires different parts of code <br>
to have an 'indent' before them. Pythons indentation enables whichever<br>
program you use to easily understand your code and tell the difference between<br>
'if' statements,functions,'for' loops and any other programming concepts in your code.<br>
