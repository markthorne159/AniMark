## Basics Concepts In Python

Compared to other programming languages Python has two main differences, the use of the word "def" instead of "function" and indentation.
Of the two things mentioned here using def over function is the easiest to get used to, all you need to do is write out the function in the exact same way as you normally would but just replace the word "function" with "def". Python also uses a colon to start functions as opposed to the braces or brackets that most other programming languages use.
