<h1>Arrays<h1>

<p id = "Intro"> At first glance arrays can see like an intimidating concept. <br> However once you get used to using them you'll be glad you did.<br> 
So what are arrays? They're essentially a list that can contain a large amount of variables.<br>
Having a single list of variables instead of multiple different single variables can be useful in many different situations.<br>
for example, if you have a bunch of different numbers as variables that all need to be multiplied by a different number<br> 
you would have to write multiple repating lines to carry this out.</p>

<img src = "Images/ArraysA.png" width = "350" height = "250" hspace = "10" border = "2">
<h3 style = "padding-left: 100px">Lots of repeated lines</h3>
