<h1>Functions<h1>

<div>

<p id = "Intro">
Functions are a key part in any programming language and can be used in multiple ways.<br>One of the most common uses of a function is to carry out a certain section of code each time the function is called.<br> <br>

A simple example of this is shown below: <br>
</p>

<!-- Function example -->
<img id = "Image" src = "Images/NormalLog.png" width = "400" height = "400">
<img id = "Image" src = "Images/FunctionLog.png" width = "400" height = "400">
<!-- Function example -->

<p id = "Intro">
The two examples above show the difference between not using a function and using a function in a script.<br> Image A shows the code without the function, code is often read and executed line by line. Without the use of functions <br> you would have to write the same lines of code over and over again in order for them to execute. <br> This could potentially result in you having a lot of unnecessary lines of code in your scripts.<br>Fortunately this can be avoided with use of functions. Image B shows the use of a simple function with a "for loop" as it's lines of code.<br> Once this function is created it can be called an unlimited amount of times simply by typing the name of the function followed by "()". <br> 
Whenever the code hits the call to the function it will jump to the function, carry out any instructions inside of it and then jump back <br> to the main code and carry on from when the function was first hit. From there onwards you can call back to the function and the code <br> will always carry it out before carrying on to the next line of code. Using a function to carry out different instructions <br> not only means you only need to write the code once but also makes your code tidier and easier to read. Most programming languages <br> also enable you to write functions in their own file and then reference and access them with a single line of code.<br>
</p>

<p id = "Intro">
Functions can also be given arguments or variables to perform instructions on.<br>
For example look at the function example below:<br>
</p>

<!-- Function with variable -->
<img id = "Image" src = "Images/FunctionVariable.png" width = "400", height = "400">
<!-- Function with variable -->

<p id = "Intro">You may notice that this function looks pretty much the same as the previous example.<br> The only differences are the 'N' in the brackets after the function name and the '2' in the brackets at the bottom of the code.<br> This version of the function shows how you can send variables to functions, in this instance the '2' in the brackets of the function call,<br> this variable will then take the place of the 'N' in the brackets in the function and the function will carry out all of the instructions<br> that have the letter 'N' as one of the parameters, in this case it will multiply the value of 'N' 10 times and print each answer to the console.<br> </p>
